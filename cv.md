My goal is to work as a web developer. To achieve this goal I spend as much time as possible on self-learning web development from different sources and creating my own projects. I'm a well-organized person, problem solver and employee with high attention to detail. 

In my learning projects I use technologies and frameworks:
* Javascript
* Python 3.7
* Django 3.0.8
* Flask
* jQuery
* Node.js
* React
* SQL
* Bootstrap 4
* Git

1. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python 
2. S50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
3. Full-stack open 2020
